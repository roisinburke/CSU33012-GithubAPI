# Github API Access and Visualisation Project
#### Róisín Burke | 18328036
This repository contains assignment 5 and 6 for Software Engineering CSU33012

My github project takes a github username and contacts the Github API using the axios library. It then displays the users profile picture, name, and three buttons. 
The buttons display:
- A pie chart of the languages used by the user
- A bar chart of the followers and users they're following 
- A list of github repositories including links to them

# Github API Access and Visualisation Project
#### Róisín Burke | 18328036
This repository contains assignment 5 and 6 for Software Engineering CSU33012
To try, clone the repository and once in the githubapi file, in your terminal enter 1) npm install, 2) npm start. 
The app will open and run on your browser on http://localhost:3000/

My github project takes a github username and contacts the Github API using the axios library. It then displays the users profile picture, name, and three buttons. 
The buttons display:
- A pie chart of the languages used by the user
- A bar chart of the followers and users they're following 
- A list of github repositories including links to them
